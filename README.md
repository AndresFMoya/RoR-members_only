# Members Only
This project consist of build an exclusive clubhouse (Rails app) where where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

In this project, we will build a Web App with the following technologies:
  - Ruby on Rails
  - PostgreSQL
  
### Technologies used
  
  - Ruby on Rails
  - PostgreSQL
  - Git
  - Bootstrap
  - HTML & CSS
  - Heroku
  
## Getting started
  
  To get started with the app, first clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:
  
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:AndresFMoya/RoR-members_only.git
  $ cd RoR-members_only
  ```
  
  Then install the needed gems (while skipping any gems needed only in production):
  
  ```
  $ bundle install --without production
  ```
  
  Next, migrate the database:
  
  ```
  $ rails db:migrate
  ```
  
  Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:
  
  ```
  $ rails test
  ```
  
  If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:
  
  ```
  $ rails server
  ```
